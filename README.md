# Entity_indicators_for_RE

Entity pair is an important part in relation instance for relation extraction task. This program provides a method of sensing the position and structure of entity pair based on neural networks. Main content is utilizing entity-related features to construct entity indicators.The neural network model we used in our research is BERT and CNN models.

The steps for running:

1.Excuting "python main_train.py" will start a trainning programming.

2.Excuting "python main_predict.py" will start a predicting programming.

Or excuting "python Excute_main_predict.py" will start an automic programming for predicting under the newest model.
